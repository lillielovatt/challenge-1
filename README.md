# Code Refactor Starter Code
-code edited by Lillie Lovatt 5/9/2022

Index.html file creates marketing agency website for Horiseon webpage, with best practices using elements and naming conventions.

Style.css file creates design for the website.


My instructions:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure 
independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title



-Added correct href ID to search-engine-optimization
-Added empty alts to images without description
